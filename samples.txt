# Initial state as sample extracted from IPC2008 sequential transport-strips p01.pddl task
# (Transport city-sequential-5nodes-1000size-2degree-100mindistance-2trucks-2packages-2008seed)
# MAGIC FIRST LINE ASNET SAMPLING
# Everything in a line after '#' is a comment
# Entry format:<HASH>; <FACT_GOAL_VALUES>; <FACT_VALUES>; <ACTION_APPLICABLE_VALUES>; <ACTION_NETWORK_PROBABILITIES>; <ACTION_OPT_VALUES>
# <HASH> := hash value to identify where the sample comes from
# <FACT_GOAL_VALUES> := binary value for every fact indicating whether the fact is part of the goal. Values are ordered lexicographically by fact-names in a "," separated list form.
# <FACT_VALUES> := binary values (0,1) indicating whether a fact is true. Values are ordered lexicographically by fact-names and are all "," separated in a list and are given for every fact (e.g. [0,1,1,0]).
# <ACTION_APPLICABLE_VALUES> := binary values indicating whether an action is applicable in the current state. Ordering again is lexicographically by action-names and the values are in a "," separated list form for all actions.
# <ACTION_NETWORK_PROBABILITIES> := float value for every action representing the probability to choose the action in the state according to the network policy. Values are again ordered lexicographically by action-names and values are "," separated, e.g. [0.0,0.1,0.3,0.6].
# <ACTION_OPT_VALUES> := binary value for each action indicating whether the action starts a found plan according to the teacher-search. Again ordered lexicographically by action-names in a "," separated list.
