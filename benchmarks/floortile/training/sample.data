# Everything in a line after '#' is a comment
# (NO_)GOAL_EXPLORATION indicate whether the executed network search exploration reached a goal state (or not)
# Entry format:<HASH>; <FACT_GOAL_VALUES>; <FACT_VALUES>; <ACTION_APPLICABLE_VALUES>; <ACTION_OPT_VALUES>
# <HASH> := hash value to identify where the sample comes from
# <FACT_GOAL_VALUES> := binary value for every fact indicating whether the fact is part of the goal. Values are ordered lexicographically by fact-names in a "," separated list form.
# <FACT_VALUES> := binary values (0,1) indicating whether a fact is true. Values are ordered lexicographically by fact-names and are all "," separated in a list and are given for every fact (e.g. [0,1,1,0]).
# <ACTION_APPLICABLE_VALUES> := binary values indicating whether an action is applicable in the current state. Ordering again is lexicographically by action-names and the values are in a "," separated list form for all actions.
# <ACTION_OPT_VALUES> := binary value for each action indicating whether the action starts a found plan according to the teacher-search. Again ordered lexicographically by action-names in a "," separated list.
